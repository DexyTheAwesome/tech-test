Modify the main.tf file to include the additional data drive for logs. For example, add the following code block:

```resource "google_compute_disk" "logs" {
  name  = "logs-disk"
  type  = "pd-ssd"
  size  = "10"
  zone  = var.zone
  labels = {
    logs = "true"
  }
}```

Modify the instance.tf file to attach the new data drive to the instance. For example, add the following code block:

Plan the infrastructure deployment to review the changes before applying them by running
`terraform plan`

Apply the changes to add the additional data drive for logs by running:
`terraform apply`

Confirm the changes by checking the Google Cloud Console for the new data drive attached to the instance.

Benefex Notes
It is important to ensure the new data drive is appropriately sized for the expected amount of logs.
Labels can be added to resources to facilitate easier management and organization.
